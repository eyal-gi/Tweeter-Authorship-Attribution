# Tweeter-Authorship-Classification

This project was done as part of an NLP class. The task is to calissy whether a tweet from the USA president's Tweeter account was written by the president or
by a staff member, during the term of Donald Trump.

The raw data contains the tweet, the user, time stamp, and the device the tweet was sent from.

Our optimal model achieved the **best results in class** on the given unlabled test set.
